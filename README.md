# ping-pong-lua
Ping Pong game written in Lua using Love2D

### This is still in progress, but some crucial mechanics have already been created; object collision, collision between players and ball (thanks to [bump.lua](https://github.com/kikito/bump.lua))

I have used a demo from bump.lua GitHub page as my template.

This has been my very first project ever in programming and I will try my best to make it as best as possible.
